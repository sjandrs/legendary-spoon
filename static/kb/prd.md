## 6. Narrative

A typical user journey begins with a sales representative receiving a new lead through the system. They create a contact record with relevant account information, initiate a deal in the pipeline, and begin tracking interactions. As the deal progresses through stages, automated workflows trigger appropriate follow-up tasks and notifications. Upon deal closure, the system automatically generates a project and work order, scheduling the service with an appropriate technician based on location, availability, and qualifications. The customer receives automated communications throughout the service lifecycle, from appointment confirmations to completion surveys. Meanwhile, managers access real-time dashboards showing team performance, revenue forecasts, and operational metrics, enabling data-driven decisions that drive business growth and customer satisfaction.
