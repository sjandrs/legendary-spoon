# Converge Frontend

This is the frontend for the Converge CRM/Business Management tool, built with React and Vite. It communicates with the Django backend via RESTful APIs to provide a dynamic and responsive user experience.

## Getting Started

To get the frontend development server running, follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run the following command to install the necessary packages:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode using Vite. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port specified in your terminal) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run lint`

Lints the project files using ESLint to check for code quality and style issues.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build locally to preview the application as it would appear in a production environment.

## Key Technologies

This project is built with a modern frontend stack, including:

-   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **Vite:** A next-generation frontend tooling that provides a faster and leaner development experience.
-   **React Router:** For declarative routing and navigation within the application.
-   **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.
-   **Chart.js / Recharts:** For data visualization and rendering interactive charts.
-   **React Markdown:** To render Markdown content, used in features like the knowledge base.
-   **ESLint:** For static code analysis to find and fix problems in the JavaScript code.
