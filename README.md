## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the Converge CRM application running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Python (3.9 or higher)
*   Node.js (v18 or higher) and npm
*   A Python virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv`)

### Backend Setup (Django)

1.  **Navigate to Project Root:**
    Open a terminal in the project's root directory (`c:\Users\sjand\ws`).

2.  **Create & Activate Virtual Environment:**
    ```powershell
    # Create the virtual environment (only needs to be done once)
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Apply Database Migrations:**
    This command sets up your database schema.
    ```bash
    py manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Seed the Database (Important!):**
    To populate the application with essential sample data for testing, run the seed command.
    ```bash
    py manage.py seed_data
    ```

6.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    The Django development server will start, typically on `http://localhost:8000`.
    ```bash
    py manage.py runserver
    ```

### Frontend Setup (React)

1.  **Navigate to Frontend Directory:**
    Open a *new* terminal for the frontend.
    ```powershell
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    The Vite development server will start, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Accessing the Application

Once both servers are running, you can access the Converge application by navigating to **`http://localhost:5173`** in your web browser.

## üîë Key Conventions & Development Notes

*   **Database Seeding:** The `py manage.py seed_data` command is crucial for development. It populates the database with users, deal stages, task types, and sample CRM data, which is necessary for many UI components to render correctly.
*   **API Endpoints:** The backend provides a RESTful API. The primary API routes are defined in `main/api_urls.py`.
*   **UI Styling:** The project uses a global `.striped-table` class for zebra-striping on tables and lists to improve readability. The UI aims for a compact and professional feel on desktop.
*   **Knowledge Base:** The changelog and other documentation are stored as Markdown files in the `static/kb/` directory and served via the API.
*   **Authentication:** The application uses a token-based authentication system managed by Django.
