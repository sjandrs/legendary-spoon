## CI Status

![Spec Validation](https://github.com/sjandrs/legendary-spoon/actions/workflows/spec-validate.yml/badge.svg)

### Spec compilation (compiled spec)

You can generate a single compiled specification from all Markdown files in `spec/`.

- Local usage (Windows PowerShell):
    ```powershell
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    python tools/spec_compile.py --src spec --out spec/COMPILED_SPEC.md
    # Optional: include subfolders
    python tools/spec_compile.py --src spec --out spec/COMPILED_SPEC.md --recursive
    ```
    Notes:
    - The compiler demotes H1 headings so the compiled document has a single top-level title.
    - File ordering prioritizes `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, then any `order: N` front matter, then filename.
    - The compiled file (`spec/COMPILED_SPEC.md`) is gitignored by default.

- In CI: the workflow `.github/workflows/spec-compile.yml` runs on every push/PR and uploads the compiled doc as an artifact named `compiled-spec`. To download it:
    1) Open the run in GitHub Actions ‚Üí Spec Compile job
    2) Scroll to Artifacts ‚Üí download `compiled-spec`


## ÔøΩ Documentation

*   **[Testing Automation Guide](docs/TESTING_AUTOMATION.md)**: Comprehensive documentation for automated testing, CI/CD, and quality assurance
*   **[API Documentation](docs/API.md)**: REST API endpoints and usage examples
*   **[Development Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)**: Setup, conventions, and development workflows
*   **[Field Service Management](docs/FIELD_SERVICE_MANAGEMENT.md)**: Complete guide to advanced scheduling and service management features
*   **[Status Report (2025-10-09)](docs/STATUS_2025-10-09.md)**: Current progress, quality gates, risks, and next steps
*   **[ADR-001 Migration Checklist](docs/ADR-001-migration-checklist.md)**: Operational plan to consolidate EnhancedUser ‚Üí CustomUser

### Architecture Decision Records

- ADR-001: User Model Consolidation ‚Äî `docs/ADR-001-user-model-consolidation.md` outlines merging EnhancedUser capabilities into CustomUser, including migration and rollback plans.
    - See also: `docs/ADR-001-migration-checklist.md` for the phased rollout, data migration, and rollback procedure.

### Developer Tips

- Use the `log_activity` helper (defined in `main/api_views.py`) for audit logging on state-changing actions. It standardizes entries and prevents failures from impacting primary flows.

- Permission coverage examples live in:
    - `main/tests/test_permissions_minimal.py`
    - `main/tests/test_permissions_deeper.py`
    - `main/tests/test_permissions_payments_journal.py`

## ÔøΩüõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework
*   **Frontend:** React, Vite, React Router
*   **Database:** SQLite (for development)
*   **Styling:** CSS with a focus on a clean, professional, and compact UI.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the Converge CRM application running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Python (3.9 or higher)
*   Node.js (v18 or higher) and npm
*   A Python virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv`)

### Backend Setup (Django)

1.  **Navigate to Project Root:**
    Open a terminal in the project's root directory (`c:\Users\sjand\ws`).

2.  **Create & Activate Virtual Environment:**
    ```powershell
    # Create the virtual environment (only needs to be done once)
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Apply Database Migrations:**
    This command sets up your database schema.
    ```bash
    py manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Seed the Database (Important!):**
    To populate the application with essential sample data for testing, run the seed command.
    ```bash
    py manage.py seed_data
    ```

6.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    The Django development server will start, typically on `http://localhost:8000`.
    ```bash
    py manage.py runserver
    ```

### Frontend Setup (React)

1.  **Navigate to Frontend Directory:**
    Open a *new* terminal for the frontend.
    ```powershell
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    The Vite development server will start, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Accessing the Application

Once both servers are running, you can access the Converge application by navigating to **`http://localhost:5173`** in your web browser.

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

Converge CRM includes comprehensive automated testing to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

### Automated Testing Setup

1. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   .\setup_testing.bat

   # Linux/Mac
   ./setup_testing.sh
   ```

2. **Install pre-commit hooks:**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

  - Authentication & permissions
  - API endpoints & business logic

- **Frontend (React):**
  - Component rendering and interactions
  - API integration
  - User interface functionality

### Writing Tests

#### Backend Tests
```python
# main/tests.py
class MyFeatureTests(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Test data setup

    def test_feature_functionality(self):
        # Test implementation
```

#### Frontend Tests
```jsx
// src/Component.test.jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';

test('renders component correctly', () => {
  render(<MyComponent />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Expected Text')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## üîë Key Conventions & Development Notes

*   **Database Seeding:** The `py manage.py seed_data` command is crucial for development. It populates the database with users, deal stages, task types, and sample CRM data, which is necessary for many UI components to render correctly.
*   **API Endpoints:** The backend provides a RESTful API. The primary API routes are defined in `main/api_urls.py`.
*   **UI Styling:** The project uses a global `.striped-table` class for zebra-striping on tables and lists to improve readability. The UI aims for a compact and professional feel on desktop.
*   **Knowledge Base:** The changelog and other documentation are stored as Markdown files in the `static/kb/` directory and served via the API.
*   **Authentication:** The application uses a token-based authentication system managed by Django.
