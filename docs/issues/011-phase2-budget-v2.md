# 011 – Phase 2: Finance & Budget V2 Completion

Milestone: Phase 2 – Finance & Budget V2

## Goals
- Finish Budget V2 parity with canonical spec (copy last year, locks, normalize, nested writes).
- Harden invariants across serializer, model, DB constraints, and signals.
- Expand tests (unit, API, Cypress, a11y) and docs.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Serializer/Model invariants: proofs via tests
- [ ] API docs for nested writes with examples and error shapes
- [ ] Cypress happy-path + edge cases (invalid totals, locks)
- [ ] Frontend editor polish and accessibility

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All Budget V2 stories in static/kb/user-stories.md covered by tests
- [ ] CI green, coverage non-decreasing
- [ ] Docs updated in docs/API.md
