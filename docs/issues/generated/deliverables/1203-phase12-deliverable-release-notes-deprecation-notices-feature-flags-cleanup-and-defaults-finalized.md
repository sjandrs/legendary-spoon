# Phase 12 — Release notes; deprecation notices; feature flags cleanup and defaults finalized.

Parent: Phase 12 — Documentation, UAT & Release Hardening — 8%
Milestone: Phase 12

Acceptance Criteria
- 100% of canonical REQs validated with passing automated tests and docs references.
- All quality gates PASS in CI; UAT sign-off received; zero high/critical known issues.
- --
- Backend: API parity, validation, permissions, analytics verification, performance tuning, observability hooks, security hardening, migrations.
- Frontend: Technician/User Mgmt, Field Service, Analytics, Budget V2 UX, i18n, a11y, performance.
- QA: Coverage uplift to 100% REQ validation; a11y/perf/security checks; CI quality gates.
- Docs: API and feature guides updated continuously; JSON Schemas maintained; runbooks and playbooks authored.
- DevOps: CI/CD guards (tests/coverage/a11y/perf/security), environment parity, secrets, monitoring, alerting.
- Build & Lint: PASS per MR; no new warnings.
- Tests: PASS (backend + frontend); coverage thresholds enforced (≥70% rising to ≥80% by Phase 12 for changed areas).
- Accessibility: cypress-axe AA checks on major screens.
- Performance: Lighthouse CI and API perf tests within budgets.
- Security: No high/critical CVEs; permission matrix tests PASS.
- Documentation: Updated for each endpoint/component with examples and error handling.
- Phases 1–6: ~7–8.5 weeks (from existing plan to ≥60%).
- Phases 7–12: ~6–8 weeks (parallelizable by squads).
- Total: ~13–16.5 weeks (subject to team size and parallelization).
- API drift vs. existing clients — Mitigation: deprecation policy, feature flags, migration windows.
- UI complexity (maps/calendar/signature/i18n) — Mitigation: progressive enhancement; MSW/Cypress stubs.
- Test flakiness — Mitigation: quarantine, deterministic seeds, focused retries where appropriate.
- Security regressions — Mitigation: CI security gates, dependency monitoring, periodic audits.
- Performance regressions — Mitigation: perf CI gates and budget enforcement.
- Weekly checkpoint: % REQs validated, failing tests by phase, a11y/perf/security status, docs delta.
- Phase exit requires: All acceptance criteria met, quality gates PASS, docs updated, and stakeholder sign-off where applicable.
- Finance: REQ-101..105, REQ-102 Expenses, REQ-103 Work Orders/Invoices — Phases 1–2, 11
- Workflow: REQ-201..205 — Phases 1, 4
- Analytics: REQ-301..302 — Phase 5
- Technician & Users: REQ-401..424 — Phase 3
- Field Service: REQ-501..529 — Phase 4
- Frontend Testing & QA: REQ-601..630 — Phases 6, 12
- i18n/Security/Perf/Observability/DevOps — Phases 7–10 (mapped to cross-cutting REQs/standards where defined)
