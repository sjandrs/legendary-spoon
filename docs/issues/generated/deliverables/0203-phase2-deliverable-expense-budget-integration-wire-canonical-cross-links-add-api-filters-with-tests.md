# Phase 2 — Expense/Budget integration: Wire canonical cross-links (e.g., cost center drill-through, budget-to-expense summaries); add API filters (by year, cost center) with tests.

Parent: Phase 2 — Finance & Budget Operations Completion (V2)
Milestone: Phase 2 - Finance and Budget V2 Completion

Acceptance Criteria
- API tests cover: create/update (valid/invalid), replace endpoint, filters, and permissions.
- UI tests (Cypress): happy path create/edit; visual validity; copy last year; a11y check.
- Docs/API.md: Request/response samples, invariants, and error payloads.
