# Phase 9 — Performance & Scalability — 6%

Milestone: Phase 9

Focus: Meet canonical performance budgets and scalability targets.

Deliverables
- Backend: N+1 query audits; DB indices; caching strategies (per endpoint where beneficial); pagination defaults.
- Frontend: Bundle analysis; code splitting; lazy loading; memoization; virtualization for large lists.
- Load/perf tests (API + UI) with target SLAs; Lighthouse CI integration for key pages.

Acceptance Criteria
- Performance SLAs met (P95 latency, throughput) under defined load; Lighthouse scores within targets.
- Perf regressions prevented with CI gates.
