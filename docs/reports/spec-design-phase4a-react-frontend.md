## 7. Rationale & Context

### Design Decisions

**Component Architecture**: The decision to build upon existing Converge component patterns ensures consistency and reduces development time while maintaining the established user experience.

**Real-time Updates**: Implementing real-time updates for technician status and work order assignments is critical for field service operations where conditions change rapidly.

**Progressive Disclosure**: Complex technician management data is presented using progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming users while maintaining access to detailed information.

**Mobile-First Design**: Field service managers often work on mobile devices, making responsive design and mobile-first approach essential for user adoption.

## 9. Examples & Edge Cases

### Technician Assignment Edge Cases

```javascript
// Edge Case: Multiple technicians with same qualifications
const resolveTechnicianTieBreaker = (qualifiedTechnicians) => {
  if (qualifiedTechnicians.length > 1) {
    // Rank by distance, then by availability, then by workload
    return qualifiedTechnicians.sort((a, b) => {
      if (a.distance !== b.distance) return a.distance - b.distance;
      if (a.availabilityScore !== b.availabilityScore) return b.availabilityScore - a.availabilityScore;
      return a.currentWorkload - b.currentWorkload;
    });
  }
  return qualifiedTechnicians;
};

// Edge Case: Emergency assignment override
const handleEmergencyAssignment = (workOrder, technician) => {
  if (workOrder.priority === 'emergency') {
    // Allow assignment even if technician is at capacity
    return assignWithOverride(workOrder, technician, {
      reason: 'Emergency override',
      approvedBy: currentUser.id,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }
};
```

### Certification Expiration Handling

```javascript
// Progressive notification system
const getCertificationAlertLevel = (expirationDate) => {
  const daysUntilExpiry = differenceInDays(expirationDate, new Date());

  if (daysUntilExpiry < 0) return 'expired';
  if (daysUntilExpiry <= 7) return 'critical';
  if (daysUntilExpiry <= 30) return 'warning';
  if (daysUntilExpiry <= 90) return 'attention';
  return 'valid';
};
```
