# Converge CRM – Progress & Next Steps (2025-10-09)

This report summarizes the remediation, security hardening, and test automation completed this week, plus the remaining follow-ups.

## Summary
- Tests: 56/56 backend tests passing locally and in CI.
- Security: Sensitive endpoints hardened with custom permissions (Payments, JournalEntry, QuoteItem, CustomFieldValue, LedgerAccount hierarchy).
- Observability: Unified `log_activity()` helper and instrumentation across critical state changes (emails, signatures, payments, inventory, projects, scheduling).
- API Hygiene: Search/filters aligned to model fields; GlobalSearch fixed for Deals; inventory reservations optimized.
- Architecture: ADR-001 drafted to consolidate EnhancedUser → CustomUser.
- Docs: README and docs updated; added PROGRESS.md.

## What Shipped
1. Model/API alignment and migrations (DigitalSignature additives; InventoryReservation tuning; SchedulingAnalytics exposure).
2. Permission hardening with layered tests (minimal → deeper → negative cases).
3. Activity logging helper + instrumentation across high-impact endpoints.
4. Test additions: GlobalSearch, route optimization, logging flows, permission negative tests.
5. Documentation: ADR-001, PROGRESS.md, README links.

## Quality Gates
- Build/Lint: Backend lint cleanup in progress (legacy warnings deferred).
- Tests: PASS (56/56). No functional regressions detected.
- Security: Role-based access verified by tests; sensitive write paths locked down.

## Known Warnings/Risks
- DRF UnorderedObjectListWarning on several list endpoints (Accounts, Technicians, Certifications, CoverageArea, TechnicianAvailability). Risk: unstable pagination order under concurrent writes.
- ADR-001 not executed yet (user model consolidation). Requires data migration plan and feature-flagged rollout.

## Next Steps (High Priority)
1. Ordering warnings cleanup
   - Set Model.Meta ordering or ViewSet.ordering to stable keys (e.g., name, created_at).
   - Add minimal tests asserting deterministic ordering for list endpoints.
2. ADR-001 migration plan execution
   - Prepare schema and data migrations; backfill; dual-write/reads if needed; rollback plan.
   - Smoke tests on staging with representative data.
3. Broaden permission coverage (optional)
   - Expand PUT/DELETE tests on other financial endpoints.
   - Explicit list scoping assertions for QuoteItem and related resources.

## Acceptance Criteria for Completion
- No UnorderedObjectListWarning in test logs; list endpoints have deterministic ordering.
- ADR-001 migration checklist approved; dry-run completed in staging; production rollout plan signed off.
- Tests extended for new ordering and permission cases; suite remains green.

## Owners (Suggested)
- Ordering cleanup: Backend/API maintainer.
- ADR-001 migration: DB lead + Auth owner.
- Test extensions: QA/dev pairing.
