# Batch 3 Hook Normalization & Fetch Test Summary

## Scope
Refactored components (plus follow-up) to enforce stable data loader patterns and add fetch-count regression tests:
- ActivityTimeline
- AnalyticsSnapshots
- InteractionList
- TechnicianPayroll
- ProjectTemplateForm
- PageForm (already had fetch tests)
- TaskAdministration (and nested TemplateForm)
- CertificationForm
- AppointmentRequestQueue (post-batch follow-up)

## Patterns Implemented
- All network loaders wrapped in `useCallback` with precise dependency arrays.
- Effects depend only on stable callbacks (removes accidental double-fetch risk).
- Each effect annotated with `// HOOK-JUSTIFY(Component:reason)` documenting rationale.
- Added/verified fetch-count tests asserting single fetch per expected scenario.

## Testing Additions
New test files:
- ActivityTimeline.fetch.test.jsx
- AnalyticsSnapshots.fetch.test.jsx
- InteractionList.fetch.test.jsx
- TechnicianPayroll.fetch.test.jsx
- ProjectTemplateForm.fetch.test.jsx
- CertificationForm.fetch.test.jsx
- (Pre-existing) PageForm.fetch.test.jsx validated.

## Lint Signal Improvements
- Eliminated all React hook dependency warnings in targeted components.
- Added ESLint ignore for `coverage/` and Node/Jest env overrides for scripts & mocks.
- Reduced overall lint errors (103 -> 83) by removing unused imports and resolving hook warnings.

## Risk Reduction
- Stable callback pattern prevents subtle infinite loops / over-fetch regressions.
- Fetch-count tests act as tripwires if future edits inadvertently add extra dependency triggers.
- HOOK-JUSTIFY comments accelerate code review comprehension.

## Remaining Work (Tracked Separately)
Planned follow-up issues:
- Bulk test unused-var cleanup.
- Runtime component minor unused variable removal.
- `no-case-declarations` fix in `App.jsx`.
- Undefined symbol investigation (`Call` in BudgetList.test.jsx).
- Additional fetch-count tests for SearchPage / SchedulingDashboard.

## Metrics
- Components normalized: 9 (including follow-up).
- New fetch-count tests: 6 (1 pre-existing validated).
- Hook warnings in scope: 0 remaining.

## Notes
This batch establishes a repeatable standard for future refactors: introduce stable callbacks first, annotate intent, then add fetch-count regression tests before broader lint cleanup.
