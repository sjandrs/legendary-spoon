## Technical Debt & Risks

### Current Technical Debt
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Quote components incomplete:** Stub methods exist, need implementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Interaction components incomplete:** Stub methods exist, need implementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Testing coverage gap:** No automated tests for new Phase 2 components
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Bundle size:** Not yet optimized with code splitting

### Mitigations Required
1. **Testing:** Allocate 2-3 days for comprehensive Jest + Cypress tests
2. **Code Splitting:** Implement React.lazy() for all new routes
3. **Performance:** Run Lighthouse audit before production deployment
4. **Accessibility:** Complete axe-core audit on all new pages

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 was successfully completed** with full production-ready features and comprehensive documentation.

**Phase 2-4 require significant additional development time** (~85 hours) to complete all 86 remaining tasks. The foundation has been established with:
- ‚úÖ Proven component patterns
- ‚úÖ API methods defined
- ‚úÖ Navigation structure redesigned
- ‚úÖ Development workflow documented

**Recommendation:** Prioritize completing Phase 2 Quotes and Interactions components (14.5 hours) to deliver tangible business value, then reassess priorities based on stakeholder feedback and user analytics.
