# Introduction

![Status: Completed](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Completed-brightgreen)

This document outlines the implementation plan to refactor the existing `SearchService` in `main/search_service.py`. The goal is to create a more modular, scalable, and performant search architecture by decoupling the search logic from the core service and introducing a provider-based strategy pattern. This will allow for easier extension, such as adding alternative search backends like Elasticsearch in the future, while improving the maintainability of the current database-backed implementation.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: The refactored search architecture must be extensible to support multiple search backends (e.g., Database, Elasticsearch).
- **REQ-002**: All existing search functionality and API endpoints must remain fully operational with no breaking changes to the public interface.
- **REQ-003**: The new architecture must follow the Strategy design pattern, allowing the search backend to be configured via Django settings.
- **REQ-004**: Performance of database queries should be analyzed and optimized.
- **CON-001**: The initial implementation will only include the existing database search logic, refactored into the new provider structure.
- **PAT-001**: The implementation must adhere to SOLID principles, particularly the Single Responsibility Principle and Open/Closed Principle.

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Implementation Phase 1: Core Abstraction & Provider Implementation

- **GOAL-001**: Abstract the core search logic into a provider-based architecture.

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-001 | Create a new directory `main/search/` to house the new modular search architecture. | | |
| TASK-002 | Define a `BaseSearchProvider` abstract base class in `main/search/base.py` with methods for `search`, `get_suggestions`, etc. | | |
| TASK-003 | Create `main/search/db_provider.py` and implement a `DatabaseSearchProvider` class that inherits from `BaseSearchProvider`. | | |
| TASK-004 | Migrate all existing database query and filtering logic from `main/search_service.py` into the `DatabaseSearchProvider`. | | |

### Implementation Phase 2: Service & Factory Refactoring

- **GOAL-002**: Refactor the `SearchService` to act as a context for the selected search provider and implement a factory for provider selection.

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-005 | Create a `SearchProviderFactory` in `main/search/factory.py` that dynamically loads and instantiates the configured search provider from Django settings. | | |
| TASK-006 | Add a `SEARCH_PROVIDER` setting in `web/settings.py`, defaulting to `main.search.db_provider.DatabaseSearchProvider`. | | |
| TASK-007 | Refactor `SearchService` in `main/search_service.py` to remove direct query logic. It will now use the factory to get a provider instance and delegate calls to it. | | |
| TASK-008 | Update `main/api_views.py` and any other consumers of `SearchService` to ensure they continue to function correctly with the refactored service. | | |

### Implementation Phase 3: Query Optimization and Indexing

- **GOAL-003**: Analyze and improve the performance of the database search provider.

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-009 | Analyze the queries in `DatabaseSearchProvider` to identify performance bottlenecks, particularly for full-text search and joins. | | |
| TASK-010 | Add appropriate database indexes (`db_index=True` or `Meta.indexes`) to fields on models like `Contact`, `Account`, and `Deal` that are frequently used in search queries. | | |
| TASK-011 | Optimize queries by ensuring `select_related` and `prefetch_related` are used effectively to reduce the number of database hits. | | |

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: **Direct Integration of Elasticsearch**: Instead of building an abstraction layer first, we could have integrated Elasticsearch directly. This was rejected to avoid a large, high-risk initial change and to ensure the system remains functional with the existing database backend. The provider model allows for a phased, lower-risk rollout.
- **ALT-002**: **Keep Monolithic Service**: We could continue adding logic to the existing `SearchService`. This was rejected because it leads to a monolithic, hard-to-maintain service that violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes future extensions difficult.

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: **Django Settings**: The new architecture will depend on a new `SEARCH_PROVIDER` setting in `web/settings.py`.
- **DEP-002**: **API Consumers**: All parts of the application that currently use `SearchService` will need to be tested to ensure they work with the refactored, delegation-based version.

## 5. Files

- **FILE-001**: `spec/refactor-search-service-1.md` (This file)
- **FILE-002**: `main/search_service.py` (To be heavily refactored)
- **FILE-003**: `main/search/base.py` (New file)
- **FILE-004**: `main/search/db_provider.py` (New file)
- **FILE-005**: `main/search/factory.py` (New file)
- **FILE-006**: `web/settings.py` (To be modified)
- **FILE-007**: `main/models.py` (To be modified with database indexes)
- **FILE-008**: `main/tests.py` (To be updated to test the new architecture)

## 6. Testing

- **TEST-001**: Create unit tests for the `SearchProviderFactory` to ensure it correctly loads the provider from settings.
- **TEST-002**: Create unit tests for the `DatabaseSearchProvider` to validate its search and suggestion logic independently.
- **TEST-003**: Update existing integration tests for the search API endpoints to ensure they pass with the refactored `SearchService`.
- **TEST-004**: Add a new integration test that swaps the `SEARCH_PROVIDER` setting at runtime (using `override_settings`) to verify the dynamic loading capability.

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: **Performance Regression**: The introduction of an abstraction layer could introduce a minor performance overhead. This will be mitigated by query analysis and optimization in Phase 3.
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: The current database-backed search performance is sufficient for the short term, allowing for a phased refactoring approach without an immediate need for a new search backend like Elasticsearch.
