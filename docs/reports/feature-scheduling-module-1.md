# Introduction

![Status: Complete](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Complete-green)

This document outlines the implementation plan for a new **Advanced Field Service Management Module** within the Converge CRM platform. The module will provide capabilities for intelligent scheduling, multi-channel notifications, dynamic paperwork, and workflow automation. This feature will enhance operational efficiency, improve customer experience, and provide deep analytical insights.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: A new `ScheduledEvent` model must be created to link a `WorkOrder` to an assigned `Technician` for a specific date and time, with support for recurrence rules.
- **REQ-002**: The system must automatically send notifications to a `Technician` when a `WorkOrder` is assigned to them.
- **REQ-003**: The system must automatically send a pre-appointment reminder notification to the `Customer` 24 hours before the scheduled time.
- **REQ-004**: Customer-facing notifications must include relevant paperwork as a PDF attachment.
- **REQ-005**: A new `NotificationLog` model must be created to log the status and history of all automated communications across all channels (e.g., email, SMS).
- **REQ-006**: New API endpoints must be created to support CRUD operations for scheduling, templates, and to provide views for technician and manager schedules.
- **REQ-007**: The frontend must include a calendar-based interface for viewing and managing schedules.
- **REQ-008**: A new `PaperworkTemplate` model must be created to allow users to define custom document templates with placeholders and conditional logic.
- **REQ-009**: The system must provide a user interface for creating, editing, and deleting `PaperworkTemplate`s.
- **REQ-010**: All relevant developer and user documentation must be updated.
- **REQ-011**: The system must integrate with a mapping service to calculate travel times and suggest optimized routes for technicians.
- **REQ-012**: A secure customer-facing portal must be created for self-service appointment booking requests.
- **REQ-013**: The system must support multi-channel notifications (Email and SMS).
- **REQ-014**: Technicians must have a mechanism to trigger a real-time "On My Way" notification to the customer, including a calculated ETA.
- **REQ-015**: The system must support capturing digital signatures on paperwork.
- **REQ-016**: The system must support automated post-appointment workflows (e.g., sending final invoice, customer satisfaction survey).
- **REQ-017**: Scheduling a `WorkOrder` must create a soft reservation for required inventory items from the `WarehouseItem` model.
- **REQ-018**: A new analytics dashboard must be created to display key scheduling and technician performance metrics.
- **CON-001**: The implementation must use Django's existing signal system for triggering automated workflows.
- **CON-002**: The solution must integrate with the existing `WorkOrder`, `Technician`, `Account`, `Contact`, and `WarehouseItem` models.
- **GUD-001**: An appropriate third-party library for PDF generation (e.g., WeasyPrint) should be used.

## 2. User Stories

- **SCHED-001 (Manager)**: As a Manager, I want to schedule a work order for a technician so that I can assign tasks efficiently and manage my team's time.
- **SCHED-002 (Technician)**: As a Technician, I want to receive an email and/or SMS notification when a work order is assigned to me so that I am immediately aware of my new task.
- **SCHED-003 (Customer)**: As a Customer, I want to receive an email or SMS reminder 24 hours before a scheduled service, including necessary paperwork as a PDF, so that I am prepared for the appointment.
- **SCHED-004 (Administrator)**: As an Administrator, I want to view a log of all automated notifications sent by the system so that I can audit communications and troubleshoot delivery issues.
- **SCHED-005 (Manager)**: As a Manager, I want to view a consolidated calendar of my team's schedule so that I can effectively manage workloads and availability.
- **SCHED-006 (Administrator)**: As an Administrator, I want to create and manage custom paperwork templates with conditional logic so that I can create dynamic, standardized documents.
- **SCHED-007 (Technician)**: As a Technician, I want to view my own upcoming schedule on a calendar so that I can easily plan my workday.
- **SCHED-008 (Manager)**: As a Manager, I want the system to suggest an optimized route when I schedule multiple jobs for a technician, so that I can minimize travel time.
- **SCHED-009 (Customer)**: As a Customer, I want to request an appointment through a portal by selecting from available time slots, so that I can schedule service at my convenience.
- **SCHED-010 (Manager)**: As a Manager, I want to approve or deny customer appointment requests from a queue, so that I can control the final schedule.
- **SCHED-011 (Manager)**: As a Manager, I want to create a recurring schedule for a service contract, so that maintenance appointments are automatically generated.
- **SCHED-012 (Technician)**: As a Technician, I want to press a button to notify the customer I'm on my way, including an ETA, so that they are prepared for my arrival.
- **SCHED-013 (Customer)**: As a Customer, I want to be able to digitally sign paperwork on the technician's device or via a link, so that we can have a paperless and efficient process.
- **SCHED-014 (System)**: As the System, after a work order is completed, I want to automatically send the final invoice and a satisfaction survey to the customer, so that the service lifecycle is closed efficiently.
- **SCHED-015 (System)**: As the System, when a work order is scheduled, I want to reserve the necessary parts from inventory, so that we can prevent stock conflicts.
- **SCHED-016 (Manager)**: As a Manager, I want to view a dashboard with technician utilization rates, on-time performance, and travel times, so that I can make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency.

## 4. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Use a third-party scheduling service (e.g., Calendly API). This was rejected to maintain full control over business logic and data.
- **ALT-002**: Build a monolithic service instead of integrating multiple APIs (mapping, SMS). Rejected due to high development cost and time.

## 5. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: PDF generation library (`WeasyPrint`).
- **DEP-002**: Configured Django email backend.
- **DEP-003**: Frontend calendar library (`FullCalendar`).
- **DEP-004**: Task queue system (`Celery` with `Redis` is recommended).
- **DEP-005**: Mapping Service API (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox).
- **DEP-006**: SMS Gateway Service (e.g., Twilio).
- **DEP-007**: Digital Signature library (e.g., `django-signature-pad`).

## 6. Documentation

- **DOC-001**: All new models, services, and API endpoints must be documented in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` and `docs/API.md`.
- **DOC-002**: User-facing documentation in `static/kb/` must be updated with articles for all new features.
- **DOC-003**: The main `copilot-instructions.md` will be updated to reflect the new modules and their architecture.
- **DOC-004**: The new user stories (SCHED-001 to SCHED-016) must be added to `static/kb/user-stories.md`.

## 7. Files

- **FILE-001**: `main/models.py` (Updated and new models)
- **FILE-002**: `main/admin.py` (Register new models)
- **FILE-003**: `main/signals.py` (New signal handlers)
- **FILE-004**: `main/notification_service.py` (New file)

- **FILE-015**: `main/templates/emails/` (New/updated templates)
- **FILE-016**: `static/kb/user-stories.md` (Update with new user stories)

## 8. Testing

- **TEST-001**: Create unit tests for all new and updated models.
- **TEST-002**: Create unit tests for all new services (`notification`, `map`, `inventory`), mocking external APIs.
- **TEST-003**: Create integration tests for all signal handlers and post-appointment workflows.
- **TEST-004**: Create API tests for all new endpoints, checking permissions, business logic, and data validation.
- **TEST-005**: Create frontend component tests for all new UI components, including the signature pad and analytics dashboard.
- **TEST-006**: All new tests must be integrated into the project's CI/CD pipeline and configured to run automatically.

## 9. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: System-level dependencies for `WeasyPrint` (Pango, Cairo) may complicate deployment.
- **RISK-002**: High volume of notifications or API calls to third-party services may incur significant costs and require robust error handling and rate limiting.
- **RISK-003**: The complexity of integrating multiple external services increases potential points of failure.
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: A mechanism for running periodic tasks (cron job or Celery Beat) is available in the deployment environment.
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: The application will be configured with valid API keys and settings for all external services.
