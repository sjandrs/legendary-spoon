## 3. Requirements, Constraints & Guidelines

### **REQ-001: Comprehensive Component Testing**
All 60 untested React components must have complete test suites including:
- Unit tests with 90% minimum code coverage
- Integration tests for all API interactions
- Accessibility compliance validation (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Error state and loading state validation
- Role-based access control testing

### **REQ-002: Test Pattern Standardization**
Implement standardized test patterns for each component type:
- Form components (15 identified): Validation, submission, error handling
- List/Management components (12 identified): Data display, pagination, filtering
- Dashboard/Analytics components (5 identified): Chart rendering, data visualization
- Modal/Dialog components (8 identified): Open/close behavior, form integration
- Navigation components (6 identified): Route handling, permission-based visibility

### **REQ-003: API Integration Testing**
Every component with API dependencies must have:
- MSW handlers for all API endpoints
- Success and error response testing
- Loading state validation
- Data transformation testing
- Authentication/authorization validation

### **REQ-004: E2E Workflow Coverage**

- Use descriptive test names following Given-When-Then pattern
- Include both positive and negative test scenarios
- Mock external dependencies using MSW for API calls
- Maintain test independence (no test depends on another test's state)

### **GUD-002: Code Organization Guidelines**
- Place component tests in `frontend/src/__tests__/components/`
- Use consistent file naming: `ComponentName.test.jsx`
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks
- Use `beforeEach` for common setup, `afterEach` for cleanup
- Include test documentation comments for complex business logic

### **PAT-001: Component Testing Pattern**
```javascript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  // Setup and mocking
  const user = userEvent.setup();
  beforeEach(() => { /* setup */ });

  describe('Rendering', () => {
    it('renders with required props');
    it('shows loading state');
    it('handles empty data state');
  });

  describe('User Interactions', () => {
    it('handles form submission');
    it('validates user input');
    it('manages component state');
  });

  describe('API Integration', () => {
    it('fetches data on mount');
    it('handles API errors');
    it('updates on data changes');
  });

  describe('Accessibility', () => {
    it('meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards');
    it('supports keyboard navigation');
    it('provides screen reader support');
  });
});
```

### **PAT-002: E2E Testing Pattern**
```javascript
describe('Business Workflow', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.login('user', 'password');
    cy.intercept('GET', '/api/**', { fixture: 'mockData' });
  });

  it('completes the full business process', () => {
    cy.visit('/workflow-start');
    cy.fillForm({ /* form data */ });
    cy.submit();
    cy.verifyResult('Success message');
    cy.checkA11y(); // Accessibility validation
  });
});
```

  requiredTests: {
    rendering: string[];
    interactions: string[];
    apiIntegration: string[];
    accessibility: string[];
    roleBasedAccess: string[];
  };
  mockDependencies: string[];
  e2eScenarios: string[];

## 7. Rationale & Context

### **Business Justification**
The current 4.8% frontend test coverage represents a critical business risk for Converge CRM. With revenue-critical components (CRM, Financial Management, Field Service) lacking automated validation, the application is vulnerable to:

1. **Revenue Loss:** Untested invoicing, payment processing, and deal management components
2. **Security Vulnerabilities:** Authentication and authorization components without validation
3. **Service Delivery Failures:** Field service scheduling and work order management untested
4. **Compliance Risks:** Financial reporting and tax management components unvalidated

### **Technical Architecture Decision**
The phased implementation approach prioritizes business-critical components first, ensuring immediate risk reduction while building comprehensive coverage systematically. This approach:

1. **Minimizes Business Risk:** Critical components tested first
2. **Enables Parallel Development:** Multiple developers can work simultaneously
3. **Provides Early Wins:** Visible progress and confidence building
4. **Scales Efficiently:** Established patterns accelerate later phases

### **Quality Assurance Strategy**
Comprehensive testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, E2E) ensures:

1. **Component Isolation:** Unit tests validate individual component behavior
2. **System Integration:** Integration tests validate API interactions
3. **User Experience:** E2E tests validate complete workflows
4. **Accessibility:** Compliance testing ensures inclusive design
5. **Performance:** Benchmark testing prevents regressions
