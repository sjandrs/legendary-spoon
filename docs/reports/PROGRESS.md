# Current Progress Summary

Date: 2025-10-09
Branch: Feature-Bootcamp

## What’s Done

- Permission hardening
  - Introduced and applied custom permissions (Payments, JournalEntry, CustomFieldValue, QuoteItem, LedgerAccount)
- Activity logging
  - Added `log_activity` helper
  - Instrumented invoice emails (single + overdue), technician assign, signature verify, inventory release/consume, payment allocate
  - Extended to project status transitions and appointment reschedule/complete
- API refinements
  - Exposed extra fields: ScheduledEvent priority/location/durations, EnhancedUser job_title, Technician base_hourly_rate, InventoryReservation quantity_consumed; AppointmentRequest ordering
- Tests
  - Search and routes: GlobalSearch and route optimization coverage
  - Activity logs: invoice email, signature verify, inventory consume
  - Project/event logging: project complete; event reschedule + complete
  - Permissions (minimal): Payments, JournalEntries, CustomFieldValues, Ledger hierarchy
  - Permissions (deeper): QuoteItem owner vs manager; CustomFieldValue create/update; QuoteItem create forbidden for non-owner
- ADR
  - ADR-001: user model consolidation proposal (merge EnhancedUser fields into CustomUser)

## Quality Gates

- Backend tests: PASS (56/56)
- Lint/Typecheck: No new issues introduced; Django dynamics handled with safe guards

## Remaining Follow-ups

- Permissions
  - Optional: add PUT/DELETE negative tests for payments and journal entries
  - Optional: exercise QuoteItem list scoping more explicitly (owner-filter expectations)
- ADR Execution Plan
  - Add migration checklist and feature flag plan to docs
  - Stage data migration script; add integrity checks and rollback notes
- Documentation
  - Link ADR-001 in README/CHANGELOG
  - Brief developer guide update on new logging helper and test conventions

## Risks & Mitigations

- Dual user models: addressed by ADR; plan staged migration with fallback
- Permission regressions: covered with baseline tests; expand as features evolve
- Type checking on dynamic models: mitigated via safe getattr and config tuning

## Next Suggested Steps

1) Add 2–3 negative tests for PUT/DELETE on sensitive endpoints
2) Draft migration plan doc for ADR-001 with operational steps
3) Add a short README note about the new logging helper and usage pattern
