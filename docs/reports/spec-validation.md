Implementation alignment findings:
- Snapshot JSON schema mismatch:
  - Spec schema example:
    - generatedAt, totals { errors, warnings, problems }, rules {}
  - Current script output (tools/lint_baseline_diff.ps1):
    - keys: timestamp, totalProblems, errors, warnings, ruleCounts
  - Action: Align spec or update script for consistency; recommend updating spec to reflect actual schema or vice versa. Proposal below.
- Report title mismatch:
  - Spec: "ESLint Baseline Diff Report"
  - Script: "# ESLint Baseline Diff"
  - Action: Harmonize title (either update script heading or spec wording)
- Missing sections in generated report vs spec:
  - Spec requires "Quality Gate Result" and "Invocation Parameters" sections in Markdown report; script currently prints gate status to console only and does not embed in Markdown.
  - Action: Update script to append these sections to docs/reports/lint-baseline-diff.md.
- Trailing artifact in file:
  - The spec file appears to include a stray line "*** End Patch" at the end.
  - Action: Remove the artifact from the document.

Outcome: WARN (needs alignment with implementation)

Recommended fixes (non-breaking):
- Update spec to document the current snapshot schema used by the script:
  - {
    "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS",
    "totalProblems": 0,
    "errors": 0,
    "warnings": 0,
    "ruleCounts": { "rule": count }
    }
- Or, update the script to emit the spec’s schema (generatedAt, totals, rules). Choose one and keep consistent end-to-end.
- Update the PowerShell script to add the two Markdown sections:
  - Quality Gate Result: PASS/FAIL with thresholds and worst deltas
  - Invocation Parameters: echo MaxTotalDelta, MaxRuleDelta, TopN, FrontendDir
- Remove the trailing "*** End Patch" from the spec document.

## Next steps

- If you’d like, I can apply the low-risk fixes:
  - Add last_updated to accounting and master specs
  - Remove the stray "*** End Patch" line from the lint gating spec
  - Optionally align snapshot schema (spec or script) and update the report to include Gate Result + Parameters

- For larger changes (schema alignment), please confirm the preferred direction (update spec to match script vs. update script to match spec).
