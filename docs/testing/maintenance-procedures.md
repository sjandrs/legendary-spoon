# Test Maintenance Procedures for Converge CRM

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for maintaining test quality, coverage, and reliability in the Converge CRM project. These procedures ensure our 85% test coverage achievement is sustained and improved over time.

## Daily Maintenance Procedures

### Automated Quality Checks

**CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring**:
- Monitor GitHub Actions workflow status for test failures
- Review Codecov reports for coverage regressions
- Check Cypress E2E test results for flaky tests
- Validate accessibility compliance reports

**Immediate Response Protocols**:
1. **Test Failure**: Investigate within 2 hours of failure notification
2. **Coverage Regression**: Address coverage drops >2% immediately
3. **Performance Regression**: Investigate response time increases >20%
4. **Security Test Failure**: Escalate immediately to security team

### Developer Responsibilities

**Before Code Commit**:
```bash
# Pre-commit checklist commands
npm run test:fast                    # Quick test validation
npm run lint                         # Code quality check
npm run test:a11y                    # Accessibility validation
```

**Code Review Requirements**:
- All new code must include appropriate tests
- Test coverage cannot decrease from current levels
- Performance tests must validate acceptable response times
- Accessibility tests must maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

   - Identify areas for training improvement
   - Plan testing workshops and knowledge sharing

2. **Best Practices Review**:
   - Evaluate current testing patterns
   - Update testing guidelines and standards
   - Share lessons learned across team

## Incident Response Procedures

### Test Failure Response

**Immediate Response (0-2 hours)**:
1. Acknowledge test failure notification
2. Assess impact severity (critical/high/medium/low)
3. Begin investigation and document findings
4. Communicate status to relevant stakeholders

**Resolution Process (2-8 hours)**:
1. Identify root cause of test failure
2. Implement fix and validate solution
3. Update test to prevent future occurrences
4. Document lessons learned in team knowledge base

**Critical Failure Escalation**:
- Revenue-critical workflow test failures: Immediate escalation to tech lead
- Security test failures: Immediate escalation to security team
- Accessibility failures: Escalation to UX team within 4 hours

### Coverage Regression Response

**Coverage Drop >2%**:
1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Identify specific modules with coverage loss
   - Review recent code changes for missing tests
   - Create tickets for coverage restoration

2. **Restoration Plan**:
   - Prioritize coverage restoration by business impact
   - Assign developers to create missing tests
   - Set target completion date (typically 1 week)

**Coverage Drop >5%** (Critical):
