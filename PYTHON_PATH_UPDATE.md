# Updated Files to Use Virtual Environment Python

## Summary

Successfully updated all automated tasks and scripts to use the virtual environment's Python executable directly (.\venv\Scripts\python.exe) instead of relying on the system PATH which may point to Windows Store Python.

## Files Modified

### 1. .vscode\tasks.json
Updated 5 tasks to use .\venv\Scripts\python.exe:
- **start-backend**: Changed from Activate.ps1; python to .\venv\Scripts\python.exe
- **run-tests**: Changed from Activate.ps1; python to .\venv\Scripts\python.exe
- **run-tests-backend**: Changed from Activate.ps1; python to .\venv\Scripts\python.exe
- **run-tests-coverage**: Changed from Activate.ps1; python to .\venv\Scripts\python.exe (both commands)
- **run-lint-backend**: Changed from Activate.ps1; python to .\venv\Scripts\python.exe

### 2. start_dev.ps1
Updated the Django backend command:
- Changed from: python manage.py runserver
- Changed to: .\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver

### 3. setup_testing.bat
Updated 3 commands to use virtual environment:
- **pip install**: Changed from pip to .\venv\Scripts\pip.exe
- **test execution**: Changed from python manage.py test to .\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py test
- **documentation**: Updated command examples to show .\venv\Scripts\python.exe

## Benefits

 **No more Windows Store Python conflicts**
 **Explicit virtual environment usage**
 **No need to activate virtual environment in separate step**
 **More reliable automation**
 **Consistent Python version across all tasks**

## Verification Commands

Test that the changes work correctly:

\\\powershell
# Verify Python executable exists
Test-Path .\venv\Scripts\python.exe

# Check Python version
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe --version

# Run a test task
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py check
\\\

## Notes

- The virtual environment must be created at .\venv\ for these paths to work
- If you relocate your venv, update these paths accordingly
- All tasks now bypass the need for Activate.ps1 script execution
- Frontend tasks (npm) remain unchanged as they don't use Python

## Status:  COMPLETE

All automated tasks have been updated to use the virtual environment Python directly!
