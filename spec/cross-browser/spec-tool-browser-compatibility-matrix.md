# Browser Compatibility Matrix

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This specification defines the comprehensive browser compatibility matrix for Converge CRM, documenting supported browsers, versions, features, and known compatibility issues.

**Purpose:**
- Define minimum supported browser versions
- Document browser-specific feature support
- Track browser compatibility test results
- Guide development decisions on browser support

**Scope:**
- Desktop and mobile browser versions
- JavaScript API compatibility
- CSS feature support
- HTML5 feature support
- Known browser-specific issues and workarounds

## 2. Definitions

**Minimum Supported Version:** The oldest browser version that must receive full feature support.

**Feature Parity:** Equivalent functionality across all supported browsers (may have visual differences).

**Known Limitation:** Documented feature that works differently or is unavailable in specific browsers.

**Workaround:** Alternative implementation to provide functionality when native support is unavailable.

**Vendor Prefix:** Browser-specific CSS property prefix (-webkit-, -moz-, -ms-).

**Evergreen Browser:** Browser that automatically updates to the latest version.

## 3. Requirements, Constraints & Guidelines

### Browser Support Requirements

**REQ-101:** Application MUST support these desktop browsers with full feature parity:
- **Google Chrome:** Version 90+ (Blink engine)
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Version 88+ (Gecko engine)
- **Apple Safari:** Version 14+ (WebKit engine)
- **Microsoft Edge:** Version 90+ (Chromium/Blink engine)

**REQ-102:** Application MUST support these mobile browsers:
- **iOS Safari:** Version 14+ (WebKit engine)
- **Chrome Mobile:** Version 90+ (Blink engine)

**REQ-103:** Application SHOULD provide graceful degradation for:
- **Opera:** Version 76+ (Chromium/Blink engine)
- **Brave:** Version 1.25+ (Chromium/Blink engine)
- **Samsung Internet:** Version 14+ (Chromium/Blink engine)

**REQ-104:** Application MUST NOT support Internet Explorer (EOL since June 2022).

### Feature Support Requirements

**REQ-105:** All JavaScript ES6+ features MUST be transpiled to ES5 for broader compatibility.

**REQ-106:** CSS Grid and Flexbox MUST work consistently across all supported browsers.

**REQ-107:** All interactive elements MUST work with keyboard, mouse, and touch inputs.

**REQ-108:** Media queries MUST provide responsive layouts on all browsers.

### Testing Requirements

**REQ-109:** Each browser/version combination MUST pass 95% of automated tests.

**REQ-110:** Critical user workflows MUST be manually validated in all supported browsers.

**REQ-111:** Performance metrics MUST meet targets across all supported browsers.

### Constraints

**CON-101:** Safari on iOS uses WebKit exclusively (no Chrome/Firefox engines on iOS).

**CON-102:** Older browser versions may require polyfills increasing bundle size.

**CON-103:** Browser auto-updates may introduce breaking changes requiring rapid fixes.

**CON-104:** CSS vendor prefixes maintained via PostCSS autoprefixer only.

### Guidelines

**GUD-101:** Test in evergreen browsers using current stable versions.

**GUD-102:** Use feature detection, not browser sniffing, for conditional functionality.

**GUD-103:** Document any browser-specific CSS/JS in code comments.

**GUD-104:** Monitor browser usage analytics quarterly to adjust support matrix.

**GUD-105:** Prioritize Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge) for optimization due to market share.

## 4. Interfaces & Data Contracts

### Browser Configuration

\\\	ypescript
interface BrowserConfig {
  name: string;
  displayName: string;
  engine: 'Blink' | 'Gecko' | 'WebKit';
  minVersion: string;
  currentVersion: string;
  platform: string[];
  marketShare: number;
  supportStatus: 'full' | 'partial' | 'deprecated' | 'unsupported';
  knownIssues: string[];
}
\\\

### Feature Support Matrix

\\\	ypescript
interface FeatureSupportMatrix {
  feature: string;
  category: 'JavaScript' | 'CSS' | 'HTML5' | 'API';
  browsers: {
    chrome: FeatureSupport;
    firefox: FeatureSupport;
    safari: FeatureSupport;
    edge: FeatureSupport;
  };
}

interface FeatureSupport {
  supported: boolean;
  minVersion: string | null;
  requiresPolyfill: boolean;
  requiresPrefix: boolean;
  notes: string;
}
\\\

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

**AC-101:** Given the compatibility matrix, When reviewed, Then all supported browsers MUST have documented minimum versions.

**AC-102:** Given feature support data, When a feature is used, Then polyfills or workarounds MUST be documented.

**AC-103:** Given test results, When aggregated, Then each browser MUST show 95% pass rate.

**AC-104:** Given known issues, When documented, Then resolution status and workarounds MUST be included.

**AC-105:** Given market share data, When analyzed, Then supported browsers MUST cover 95% of user base.

## 6. Test Automation Strategy

### Browser Version Testing

**AUTO-101:** CI/CD pipeline MUST test against minimum supported versions.

**AUTO-102:** CI/CD pipeline MUST test against current stable versions.

**AUTO-103:** Weekly automated tests MUST check browser beta/canary for breaking changes.

### Feature Detection Testing

**AUTO-104:** Automated tests MUST validate feature detection logic.

**AUTO-105:** Polyfill loading MUST be tested in browsers requiring them.

### Regression Testing

**AUTO-106:** Browser-specific regression tests MUST run on every deployment.

## 7. Rationale & Context

### Why These Browsers?

**Chrome (65% market share):** Dominant browser, excellent dev tools, evergreen updates.

**Safari (20% market share):** Required for Apple ecosystem, only browser on iOS.

**Edge (5% market share):** Microsoft ecosystem, Chromium-based ensures compatibility.

**Firefox (3% market share):** Open-source alternative, Gecko engine diversity.

### Why Minimum Versions?

**Chrome 90+ (March 2021):** ES6 modules, CSS Grid, Fetch API, async/await fully supported.

**Firefox 88+ (April 2021):** Equivalent feature parity with Chrome 90.

**Safari 14+ (September 2020):** WebP support, CSS Grid improvements, modern JS features.

**Edge 90+ (April 2021):** First Chromium-based Edge with feature parity to Chrome.

### Why No IE11?

**EOL Status:** Microsoft ended support June 15, 2022.

**Modern Framework Incompatibility:** React 18, Vite require modern browser APIs.

**Market Share:** <1% globally, declining rapidly.

**Development Cost:** Polyfills and workarounds add significant complexity.

## 8. Dependencies & External Integrations

### External Systems

**EXT-101:** Can I Use API - Real-time browser feature support data.

**EXT-102:** BrowserStack/Sauce Labs - Cloud browser testing infrastructure.

### Third-Party Services

**SVC-101:** PostCSS Autoprefixer - Automatic vendor prefix insertion.

**SVC-102:** Babel - JavaScript transpilation for older browsers.

**SVC-103:** Core-js - Polyfills for missing JavaScript features.

### Infrastructure Dependencies

**INF-101:** GitHub Actions with browser installations (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

**INF-102:** macOS runner for Safari/WebKit testing.

**INF-103:** Docker containers for reproducible browser environments.

### Technology Platform Dependencies

**PLT-101:** Vite build system - Handles transpilation and polyfills.

**PLT-102:** Node.js 18+ - Required for build tools and testing frameworks.

**PLT-103:** Modern JavaScript (ES2020+) - Source code standard.
