# Test Scenarios and Critical User Workflows

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This specification defines comprehensive test scenarios and critical user workflows for cross-browser validation, ensuring consistent functionality across all supported browsers.

**Purpose:**
- Document all critical user paths requiring cross-browser testing
- Define step-by-step test scenarios with expected results
- Establish test data requirements for each workflow
- Provide acceptance criteria for each scenario

**Scope:**
- 6 critical user workflow categories
- 95+ features across 4 development phases
- End-to-end business process validation
- Data validation and error handling scenarios
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

## 2. Definitions

**Critical User Path:** Essential workflow that users must complete for the application to provide value.

**User Workflow:** Sequence of user actions to accomplish a specific business goal.

**Test Scenario:** Detailed description of conditions, actions, and expected outcomes.

**Acceptance Criteria:** Conditions that must be met for a scenario to pass.

**Test Data:** Sample data required to execute test scenarios.

**Edge Case:** Unusual or extreme conditions that test system boundaries.

## 3. Requirements, Constraints & Guidelines

### Workflow Coverage Requirements

**REQ-401:** All critical user workflows MUST be tested in all Tier 1 browsers.

**REQ-402:** Each workflow MUST have documented step-by-step test scenarios.

**REQ-403:** Test scenarios MUST include prerequisites, steps, and expected results.

**REQ-404:** Test data MUST be consistent across all browser test executions.

**REQ-405:** Edge cases MUST be documented and tested for critical workflows.

### Test Scenario Requirements

**REQ-406:** Test scenarios MUST be browser-agnostic (same steps for all browsers).

**REQ-407:** Expected results MUST be clearly defined and measurable.

**REQ-408:** Test scenarios MUST include both positive and negative test cases.

**REQ-409:** Data validation scenarios MUST cover all form inputs.

**REQ-410:** Error handling scenarios MUST validate user-friendly error messages.

### Constraints

**CON-401:** Test scenarios assume backend API is functional and stable.

**CON-402:** Performance scenarios assume standard network conditions (not throttled).

**CON-403:** Mobile scenarios may require real devices for accurate testing.

**CON-404:** Test data must be reset between workflow executions.

### Guidelines

**GUD-401:** Use descriptive scenario names that clearly indicate the workflow.

**GUD-402:** Break complex workflows into smaller, manageable test scenarios.

**GUD-403:** Document both happy path and error scenarios for each workflow.

**GUD-404:** Include screenshots in manual test documentation for visual reference.

**GUD-405:** Use data-testid attributes for reliable element selection in automation.

## 4. Interfaces & Data Contracts

### Test Scenario Template

\\\	ypescript
interface TestScenario {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: 'CRM' | 'Analytics' | 'CMS' | 'Admin' | 'Navigation' | 'Mobile';
  priority: 'Critical' | 'High' | 'Medium' | 'Low';
  prerequisites: string[];
  testSteps: Array<{
    stepNumber: number;
    action: string;
    expectedResult: string;
    data?: Record<string, any>;
  }>;
  testData: Record<string, any>;
  acceptanceCriteria: string[];
  browsers: Array<'Chrome' | 'Firefox' | 'Safari' | 'Edge'>;
  automationStatus: 'Automated' | 'Manual' | 'Partial';
}
\\\

### Workflow Execution Result

\\\	ypescript
interface WorkflowExecutionResult {
  scenarioId: string;
  executedAt: string;
  browser: {
    name: string;
    version: string;
  };
  steps: Array<{
    stepNumber: number;
    status: 'Pass' | 'Fail' | 'Skip';
    actualResult?: string;
    screenshot?: string;
    duration: number;
  }>;
  overallStatus: 'Pass' | 'Fail' | 'Blocked';
  totalDuration: number;
}
\\\

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

**AC-401:** Given critical workflow, When executed in all browsers, Then 95% steps MUST pass.

**AC-402:** Given test scenario, When executed, Then actual results MUST match expected results.

**AC-403:** Given workflow execution, When completed, Then all business rules MUST be validated.

**AC-404:** Given error scenario, When triggered, Then user-friendly error message MUST display.

**AC-405:** Given edge case, When tested, Then system MUST handle gracefully without crashes.

## 6. Test Automation Strategy

### Automation Approach

**Cypress E2E Tests:**
- Implement all critical workflows as Cypress test specs
- Use Page Object Model for maintainability
- Execute across Chrome, Firefox, Edge

**Playwright Tests:**
- Implement Safari-specific scenarios
- Focus on WebKit-specific edge cases

**Manual Testing:**
- Visual verification for UI/UX quality
- Exploratory testing for undocumented scenarios
- Real device testing for mobile workflows

## 7. Rationale & Context

### Why Document Critical Workflows?

**Risk Mitigation:** Critical workflows represent highest-risk areas where bugs have maximum user impact.

**Test Prioritization:** Limited testing resources should focus on critical paths first.

**Cross-Browser Validation:** Different browsers may handle workflows differently, requiring explicit validation.

**Regression Prevention:** Documented workflows serve as regression test suite for future releases.

## 8. Dependencies & External Integrations

### External Systems

**EXT-401:** Backend API endpoints must be available and functional.

**EXT-402:** Test database with seed data for consistent test execution.

### Third-Party Services

**SVC-401:** Chart.js library for analytics visualizations.

**SVC-402:** React Router for navigation workflows.

### Infrastructure Dependencies

**INF-401:** Development/staging environment accessible for testing.

**INF-402:** Test user accounts with appropriate permissions.
