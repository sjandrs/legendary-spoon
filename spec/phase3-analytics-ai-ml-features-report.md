## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **Deal Predictions Accuracy Depends on Historical Data**
   - **Severity:** Medium - New accounts may have insufficient data
   - **Workaround:** Display helpful message when data is insufficient
   - **Future Enhancement:** Implement baseline models for new accounts

2. **CLV Calculation Requires Transaction History**
   - **Severity:** Medium - Won't work for contacts without purchases
   - **Workaround:** Empty state explains data requirements
   - **Future Enhancement:** Estimated CLV based on similar customers

3. **Revenue Forecast Limited to Historical Patterns**
   - **Severity:** Low - May not predict black swan events
   - **Workaround:** Confidence intervals show range of possibilities
   - **Future Enhancement:** Incorporate external market indicators

4. **No Real-time Model Retraining**
   - **Severity:** Low - Predictions based on periodic model updates
   - **Workaround:** Models updated nightly (backend)
   - **Future Enhancement:** Implement streaming ML pipeline

### Technical Debt Created

1. **Chart.js Bundle Size Impact**
   - **Impact:** +33 KB to bundle size
   - **Mitigation Plan:** Implement tree shaking to reduce unused Chart.js modules
   - **Target:** Reduce Chart.js impact by 40% through selective imports

2. **No Offline Analytics**
   - **Impact:** Features unavailable without internet connection
   - **Mitigation Plan:** Implement service worker caching for historical data
   - **Target:** Enable offline viewing of cached predictions

3. **Limited Customization Options**
   - **Impact:** Users cannot customize chart colors or layouts
   - **Mitigation Plan:** Add user preference settings in Phase 4
   - **Target:** Customizable color schemes and chart types
