## 5. Acceptance Criteria

### Technician Certification Management

- **AC-401**: Given a technician profile, when I add a certification with tech level 5, then the technician can be assigned to work orders requiring tech level 5 or below
- **AC-402**: Given a work order requiring certifications A and B, when I search for available technicians, then only technicians with both certifications are returned
- **AC-403**: Given a certification with expiration date, when the certification expires, then the technician is automatically excluded from relevant work order assignments
- **AC-404**: Given multiple certifications with different tech levels, when calculating technician qualifications, then the system uses the highest applicable tech level for assignment eligibility

### Coverage Area Management

- **AC-405**: Given a technician with coverage areas [90210, 90211], when a work order is created with address in 90210, then the technician appears in available assignments
- **AC-406**: Given a technician without coverage for zip code 90212, when a work order requires service in 90212, then the technician is excluded from assignment options
- **AC-407**: Given multiple technicians covering the same zip code, when searching for available technicians, then results are sorted by travel time and availability

### Availability Management

- **AC-408**: Given a technician available Monday 9AM-5PM, when scheduling a work order for Monday 2PM, then the technician appears as available
- **AC-409**: Given a technician not available on weekends, when searching for Saturday assignments, then the technician is excluded from results
- **AC-410**: Given overlapping availability windows, when updating schedules, then the system prevents conflicts and validates time ranges

### User Hierarchy Management

- **AC-411**: Given a manager user with subordinates, when the manager views team data, then all subordinate users' data is accessible
- **AC-412**: Given a subordinate user, when attempting to access manager-level functions, then access is denied with appropriate error message
- **AC-413**: Given a user linked to a technician, when viewing user profile, then technician information and certifications are displayed

### Work Order Assignment Integration

- **AC-414**: Given a work order requiring tech level 3 certification in zip code 90210, when finding available technicians, then only qualified and geographically available technicians are returned
- **AC-415**: Given a work order assignment, when the assigned technician lacks required certifications, then the assignment is rejected with specific error details
- **AC-416**: Given multiple qualified technicians, when auto-assigning work orders, then the system prioritizes by availability, proximity, and workload balance

## 9. Examples & Edge Cases

### Certification Validation Example

```python
# Complex certification requirement scenario
work_order = WorkOrder.objects.get(id=123)
required_certs = work_order.certification_requirements.all()

# Find qualified technicians
qualified_technicians = Technician.objects.filter(
    is_active=True,
    techniciancertification__certification__in=required_certs,
    techniciancertification__is_active=True,
    techniciancertification__expiration_date__gt=timezone.now().date()
).annotate(
    cert_count=Count('techniciancertification')
).filter(
    cert_count=required_certs.count()  # Must have ALL certifications
)
```

### Coverage Area Validation Example

```python
# Geographic availability checking
def find_available_technicians(work_order):
    address_zip = work_order.service_address_zip
    
    available_techs = Technician.objects.filter(
        is_active=True,
        coveragearea__zip_code=address_zip,
        technicianavailability__weekday=work_order.scheduled_date.weekday(),
        technicianavailability__start_time__lte=work_order.scheduled_time,
        technicianavailability__end_time__gte=work_order.scheduled_time,
        technicianavailability__is_active=True
    ).distinct()
    
    return available_techs
```

### Edge Cases

1. **Certification Expiration During Assignment**: System must handle cases where certification expires between assignment and work completion
2. **Overlapping Coverage Areas**: Multiple technicians covering same zip code with different travel times and availability
3. **Hierarchical Permission Conflicts**: User hierarchy changes affecting data access permissions mid-session
4. **Bulk Assignment Failures**: Handling partial failures when bulk-assigning work orders to technicians

   - Given a work order requires both "Welding Level 2" and "Safety Training"
   - When I search for available technicians
   - Then only technicians with both active certifications are returned
   - And the search results show which certifications each technician possesses

### User Story 2: Coverage Area Management
**As a** dispatch coordinator  
**I want to** assign technicians based on geographic coverage areas  
**So that** customers receive timely service with minimal travel costs

**Scenarios:**
1. **Adding Coverage Areas**
   - Given I am managing a technician's profile
   - When I add zip codes "90210, 90211, 90212" to their coverage area
   - Then the technician becomes available for work orders in those zip codes
   - And travel time estimates are calculated and stored

2. **Geographic Assignment Validation**
   - Given a work order in zip code "10001"
   - When I search for available technicians
   - Then only technicians covering "10001" appear in results
   - And results are sorted by estimated travel time

3. **Coverage Area Conflicts**
   - Given multiple technicians cover the same zip code
   - When a work order needs assignment in that area
   - Then the system shows all qualified technicians
   - And prioritizes by availability and current workload

### User Story 3: Availability Scheduling
**As a** technician  
**I want to** set my weekly availability schedule  
**So that** I am only assigned work orders during times I can work

**Scenarios:**
1. **Setting Weekly Schedule**
   - Given I am on my availability management page
   - When I set my availability as Monday-Friday 8AM-5PM
   - Then work orders are only offered during those hours
   - And weekend assignments are automatically excluded

2. **Updating Availability**
   - Given I have existing availability settings
   - When I change Thursday to 10AM-3PM due to personal appointment
   - Then the system updates my Thursday availability
   - And any conflicting work order assignments trigger notifications

3. **Real-time Availability Checking**
   - Given I am currently assigned to a 3-hour work order
   - When dispatch searches for technicians for another job
   - Then my availability reflects the current assignment
   - And I am excluded from overlapping time slots

   - Given I am a manager with team lead privileges
   - When I add a new technician as my subordinate
   - Then the technician user account is created with proper hierarchy
   - And the technician inherits appropriate permissions from the relationship

2. **Hierarchical Data Access**
   - Given I manage a team of 5 technician-users
   - When I view my team dashboard
   - Then I can see all subordinates' work orders and performance data
   - But subordinates cannot access each other's personal information

3. **Permission Inheritance**
   - Given a user hierarchy change where a team lead is promoted to manager
   - When the promotion is processed
   - Then the user's permissions update automatically
   - And their former subordinates maintain their access levels

### User Story 6: Technician-User Linking
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** link user accounts to technician profiles  
**So that** field workers can access system features appropriate to their role

**Scenarios:**
1. **Linking User to Technician**

   - When I link them through the user management interface
   - Then the user gains access to technician-specific features
   - And the technician profile shows user login and activity data

2. **Technician Self-Service Features**
   - Given a user linked to a technician profile
   - When they log into the system
   - Then they can view their certifications, coverage areas, and availability
   - And they can update their schedule and view assigned work orders

3. **User-Technician Data Synchronization**
   - Given a linked user-technician relationship
   - When contact information is updated in either profile
   - Then both profiles reflect the changes automatically
   - And audit logs track the synchronization
