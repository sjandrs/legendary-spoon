## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Component Reusability:** UtilityNavigation follows established patterns, making it easy to integrate
2. **Route Consolidation:** Cleaning up duplicate routes improved code maintainability
3. **Backward Compatibility:** Route redirects prevent breaking existing user workflows
4. **Documentation:** Clear navigation structure documentation helps future development

### Technical Decisions
1. **Utility Nav Position:** Placed above main nav for prominence and accessibility
2. **Settings Dropdown:** Created new dropdown rather than adding to existing menus to avoid cluttering
3. **Search Integration:** Used existing SearchPage component rather than building new search UX
4. **Notification Preview:** Hardcoded 3 recent notifications for Phase 1 (real-time integration in Phase 4)

### Recommendations for Phase 2
1. **API Integration:** Connect notifications dropdown to real backend API
2. **Search Autocomplete:** Enhance global search with live suggestions
3. **Mobile Menu:** Consider hamburger menu pattern for mobile navigation
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Add Cmd/Ctrl+K for global search power users
