# Introduction

This specification defines a two-phase expansion plan for the Converge CRM accounting and business workflow modules. The goal is to deliver a comprehensive financial management suite (Phase 1) and then enable advanced workflow automation and cross-module integration (Phase 2).

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document provides requirements, constraints, and design guidelines for expanding the accounting and workflow capabilities of Converge. It is intended for developers, architects, and product managers. Assumes the current accounting foundation is in place (Ledger, WorkOrder, Invoice, Payment, etc.).

## 2. Definitions

- **GL**: General Ledger
- **P&L**: Profit and Loss Statement
- **CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **KPI**: Key Performance Indicator
- **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control
- **Deal-to-Cash**: Workflow from sales deal closure to payment collection

## 3. Requirements, Constraints & Guidelines

### Phase 1: Complete Financial Management Suite
- **REQ-101**: Implement financial reports: Balance Sheet, P&L, Cash Flow Statement
- **REQ-102**: Enable automatic invoice generation from WorkOrders
- **REQ-103**: Add payment terms, late fees, and reminders to invoices
- **REQ-104**: Implement dedicated expense tracking with receipt upload and categorization
- **REQ-105**: Add budget planning and variance tracking
- **REQ-106**: Provide tax reporting features (e.g., 1099, sales tax tracking)
- **SEC-101**: All financial data must be access-controlled by RBAC
- **CON-101**: Reports must be exportable as PDF and CSV
- **GUD-101**: UI must provide clear navigation between accounting features

### Phase 2: Enhanced Workflow Automation
- **REQ-201**: Implement automatic WorkOrder creation upon Deal closure
- **REQ-202**: Enable project billing: time tracking → billable hours → invoicing
- **REQ-203**: Integrate inventory: WorkOrders adjust Warehouse stock
- **REQ-204**: Add customer communication automation (invoice emails, reminders)
- **REQ-205**: Provide cross-module analytics (sales, project profitability, CLV)
- **PAT-201**: Use event-driven architecture for workflow triggers
- **SEC-201**: All automation actions must be logged for audit

## 4. Interfaces & Data Contracts

| /api/expenses/             | CRUD   | Manage expenses and receipts                |
| /api/budgets/              | CRUD   | Manage budgets and track variances          |
| /api/tax-reports/          | GET    | Generate tax-related reports                |

| /api/communications/email  | POST   | Send automated emails (invoices, reminders) |

**Data Contract Example: Expense**
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "date": "2025-09-29",
  "amount": 250.00,
  "category": "Travel",
  "description": "Flight to client site",
  "receipt_url": "/media/receipts/123.pdf"
}
```

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-101**: Given a set of transactions, when a user requests a Balance Sheet, then the correct report is generated and downloadable
- **AC-102**: When a WorkOrder is completed, an invoice can be generated automatically with correct line items
- **AC-103**: When an expense is logged, a receipt can be uploaded and categorized
- **AC-201**: When a Deal is marked as closed, a WorkOrder is created and linked
- **AC-202**: When time is logged on a Project, it can be billed and invoiced
- **AC-203**: When a WorkOrder is fulfilled, inventory is decremented accordingly
- **AC-204**: When an invoice is overdue, an automated reminder email is sent

## 6. Test Automation Strategy

- **Test Levels**: Unit, Integration, End-to-End
- **Frameworks**: Django TestCase, DRF APIClient, React Testing Library, Playwright
- **Test Data Management**: Use factories for transactions, expenses, and deals
- **CI/CD Integration**: All tests run in GitHub Actions on PRs to main
- **Coverage Requirements**: 90%+ for backend, 80%+ for frontend
- **Performance Testing**: Simulate report generation with large datasets

## 7. Rationale & Context

Phase 1 addresses core business needs for financial management, reducing reliance on external accounting tools. Phase 2 leverages the platform’s modularity to automate business processes, increasing efficiency and data accuracy.

## 8. Dependencies & External Integrations

### External Systems
- **EXT-101**: Email delivery service (e.g., SendGrid) for automated communications

### Third-Party Services
- **SVC-101**: PDF/CSV export library for report generation

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **INF-101**: Secure file storage for receipts and exports

### Data Dependencies
- **DAT-101**: Accurate and timely transaction data for reporting

### Technology Platform Dependencies
- **PLT-101**: Django 5.x, React 18+, DRF, PostgreSQL

### Compliance Dependencies
- **COM-101**: Financial data retention and audit requirements

## 9. Examples & Edge Cases

```python
# Example: Auto-create WorkOrder from Deal closure
def on_deal_closed(deal):
    work_order = WorkOrder.objects.create(
        deal=deal,
        ... # populate fields
    )
    return work_order

# Edge Case: Expense with missing receipt
expense = Expense.objects.create(
    amount=100,
    category="Meals",
    receipt_url=None  # Should be allowed but flagged for review
)
```

## 10. Validation Criteria

- All endpoints return correct data and enforce permissions
- Reports match accounting standards and are exportable
- Automation triggers are reliable and auditable
- UI/UX meets navigation and accessibility guidelines
