## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture

**Pattern Consistency:**
- Followed established Account component patterns exactly
- List → Detail → Form navigation flow
- Consistent error handling and loading states
- Unified styling approach across all components

**Key Features Implemented:**

1. **QuoteList Component:**
   ```jsx
   - Status filtering dropdown (5 status types)
   - Search functionality with form submission
   - Pagination (20 items per page)
   - Color-coded status badges
   - Currency formatting with Intl.NumberFormat
   - Loading skeletons for better UX
   ```

2. **QuoteDetail Component:**
   ```jsx
   - Quote information display
   - Line items table with calculations
   - Convert to Deal button (for accepted quotes)
   - Delete confirmation modal
   - Links to related entities (Account, Contact, Deal)
   - Real-time calculation of subtotal, tax, discount, total
   ```

3. **QuoteForm Component:**
   ```jsx
   - Create/Edit mode detection via useParams
   - Dynamic line item editor (add/remove rows)
   - Cascading dropdowns (Account → Contacts)
   - Real-time total calculations
   - Form validation (name, account, valid_until, line items)
   - Line item validation (product name, unit price > 0)
   ```

### API Integration

**Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /api/quotes/` - List quotes with filtering
- `GET /api/quotes/:id/` - Get quote details
- `POST /api/quotes/` - Create new quote
- `PUT /api/quotes/:id/` - Update quote
- `DELETE /api/quotes/:id/` - Delete quote
- `GET /api/quotes/:id/items/` - Get quote line items
- `POST /api/quote-items/` - Create line item
- `PUT /api/quote-items/:id/` - Update line item
- `POST /api/quotes/:id/convert-to-deal/` - Convert quote to deal

**Data Flow:**
1. User selects account → Fetches related contacts
2. User adds line items → Real-time total calculation
3. User submits form → Creates/updates quote → Creates/updates line items
4. User converts quote → Creates deal from accepted quote

### Form Validation

**Required Fields:**
- Quote name
- Account
- Valid until date
- At least one line item

**Line Item Validation:**
- Product name required
- Unit price must be > 0
- Quantity defaults to 1

**Error Handling:**
