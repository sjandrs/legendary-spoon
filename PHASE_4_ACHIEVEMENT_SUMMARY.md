## ⚠️ Known Issues & Next Steps

### Technical Debt
1. **Bundle Size:** 1,496.72 KB exceeds 500 KB threshold
   - **Recommendation:** Implement code splitting in Phase 5
   - **Priority:** Medium

2. **Admin Route Protection:** Routes need backend role enforcement
   - **Recommendation:** Enhance ProtectedRoute component
   - **Priority:** High
