# Task Checklist: Phase 6 Test Coverage Lift - Validation & Optimization

## Overview

Validate and optimize the existing comprehensive test infrastructure which already exceeds Phase 6 requirements (85% coverage achieved vs. ≥60% target) while addressing minor gaps and ensuring continued excellence.

## Objectives

- Validate current test coverage exceeds ≥60% spec validation requirement (currently at 85%)
- Address frontend test failures and linting issues identified in terminals
- Optimize test infrastructure performance and reliability
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of revenue-critical modules
- Maintain CI/CD quality gates and accessibility compliance

## Research Summary

### Project Files
- docs/reports/FRONTEND_TESTING.md - Complete testing infrastructure documentation with 279+ test cases
- frontend/cypress/e2e/accessibility-audit.cy.js - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation (27 pages, zero violations)
- frontend/jest.config.js - Jest configuration with 70% coverage thresholds enforced
- frontend/cypress.config.js - Complete E2E and component testing configuration
