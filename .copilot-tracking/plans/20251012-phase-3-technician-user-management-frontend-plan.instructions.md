# Task Checklist: Phase 3 â€” Technician & User Management Frontend (Phase 4A)

## Overview

Implement comprehensive React frontend components for technician lifecycle management, certification tracking, user hierarchy visualization, and availability scheduling, integrating with existing backend APIs.

## Objectives

- Build complete technician management UI (list/detail/edit with photo upload)
- Create certification dashboard with expiration alerts and renewal workflows
- Implement interactive coverage area map management for service territories
- Develop availability calendar with drag-and-drop weekly scheduling
- Build organization chart visualization with multiple view modes
- Add comprehensive testing coverage (Jest/RTL, Cypress E2E, accessibility)
- Ensure seamless API integration with robust loading/error states
