# Implementation Prompt: Phase 4 â€” Field Service Management Frontend Completion

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Create Changes Tracking File

You WILL create `20251012-phase-4-field-service-frontend-completion-changes.md` in #file:../changes/ if it does not exist.

### Step 2: Execute Implementation

You WILL follow #file:../../.github/task-implementation.instructions.md
You WILL systematically implement #file:../plans/20251012-phase-4-field-service-frontend-completion-plan.instructions.md task-by-task
You WILL follow ALL project standards and conventions

**CRITICAL**: If ${input:phaseStop:true} is true, you WILL stop after each Phase for user review.
**CRITICAL**: If ${input:taskStop:false} is true, you WILL stop after each Task for user review.

### Step 3: Implementation Focus

**IMPORTANT**: Phase 4 Field Service Management is ALREADY COMPLETE (29/29 tasks). This implementation focuses on:
- **Enhancement**: E2E testing, accessibility, performance optimization
- **Quality Assurance**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, mobile UX improvement
- **Production Readiness**: Advanced analytics, comprehensive testing coverage

You WILL build upon the existing complete implementation rather than recreating components.

### Step 4: Cleanup

When ALL Phases are checked off (`[x]`) and completed you WILL do the following:
  1. You WILL provide a markdown style link and a summary of all changes from #file:../changes/20251012-phase-4-field-service-frontend-completion-changes.md to the user:
    - You WILL keep the overall summary brief
    - You WILL add spacing around any lists
    - You MUST wrap any reference to a file in a markdown style link
  2. You WILL provide markdown style links to .copilot-tracking/plans/20251012-phase-4-field-service-frontend-completion-plan.instructions.md, .copilot-tracking/details/20251012-phase-4-field-service-frontend-completion-details.md, and .copilot-tracking/research/20251012-phase-4-field-service-frontend-completion-research.md documents. You WILL recommend cleaning these files up as well.
  3. **MANDATORY**: You WILL attempt to delete .copilot-tracking/prompts/implement-phase-4-field-service-frontend-completion.prompt.md

- [ ] Changes tracking file created
