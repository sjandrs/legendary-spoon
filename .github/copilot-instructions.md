# Converge CRM Development Guide

**Converge** is a Django/React CRM and Business Management platform targeting small-to-medium businesses. This guide covers essential patterns and workflows for productive development.

## ✅ Comprehensive User Story Framework Integration

**User Story Coverage**: 130+ comprehensive user stories covering every feature and capability across the entire platform
**Documentation Location**: `static/kb/user-stories.md` - Complete user story framework driving development and testing
**Implementation Status**: All Phase 1-4 backend user stories implemented and tested with 23/23 tests passing

### User Story Development Workflow
1. **Every Feature Requirement**: Must have corresponding user story with business justification
2. **API Design**: User stories directly map to RESTful endpoints in `main/api_views.py`
3. **Test Coverage**: Acceptance criteria translate to automated tests in `main/tests.py`
4. **Frontend Implementation**: User stories guide React component development patterns
5. **Business Validation**: Each story includes measurable outcomes and stakeholder value

### Complete Feature Coverage
- **46+ Django Models**: Every model in `main/models.py` has corresponding user stories
- **7 Development Phases**: CRM Core, Accounting, Workflow Automation, Analytics, Technician Management, Infrastructure, Enhanced Operations
- **Cross-Module Integration**: User stories validate complete business process workflows
- **Quality Assurance**: Acceptance criteria serve as test scenarios with automated validation

### Key User Story Categories
- **CRM Core (CRM-001→CRM-015)**: Account management, contact tracking, deal pipeline, interaction logging
- **Financial Management (ALM-001→EPP-010)**: Advanced ledger, journal automation, work orders, payment processing
- **Workflow Automation**: Time tracking, inventory management, project templates, automated workflows
- **Analytics & AI (PAI-001→PAI-015)**: Predictive analytics, CLV intelligence, revenue forecasting, business intelligence
- **Technician Operations (ETO-001→ETO-015)**: Certification management, coverage areas, availability, compliance
- **Infrastructure (NTF-001→SLM-010)**: Notifications, security, logging, content management

**Development Principle**: Every code change must align with existing user stories or create new user stories following the established framework.

## Architecture Overview

**Backend:** Django REST Framework with custom token authentication (`main/api_auth_views.py`)
**Frontend:** React + Vite with Axios API client (`frontend/src/api.js`)
**Database:** SQLite (development), with custom `CustomUser` model extending `AbstractUser`
**Project Structure:** Clean separation - Django backend serves RESTful APIs, React fronte### Current Status
- **Git Repository:** 27 files committed with comprehensive testing infrastructure
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Working correctly, identifying and fixing code quality issues
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Ready for automated testing on pull requests and pushes
- **Documentation:** Complete guides for developers and contributors
- **Testing Framework:** Backend and frontend testing ready for use (all tests passing)

**The system is now production-ready for continuous development with automated quality assurance!** 🚀

### Next Steps for Continued Development
1. **Legacy Code Cleanup** (Optional): Address the remaining flake8 issues in older files
2. **Testing Workflow Usage**: Use the new documented testing tasks for all future development
3. **Codecov Integration**: Set up coverage reporting in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Developer Onboarding**: New team members can now follow the comprehensive documentation

**The comprehensive testing automation infrastructure is now successfully deployed and operational!** 🎯

## Critical Developer Workflows

### Starting Development Environment
**Recommended:** Use VS Code Tasks (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Tasks: Run Task` → `start-dev`)
- Runs both backend (`py manage.py runserver`) and frontend (`npm run dev`) in parallel
- Configuration in `.vscode/tasks.json`
- Alternative: PowerShell script `start_dev.ps1`

### Database Setup & Seeding
```bash
py manage.py migrate                 # Apply schema changes
py manage.py seed_data              # CRITICAL: Populate test data
py manage.py set_password <user>    # Admin password reset tool
```

The `seed_data` command is essential - creates users, deal stages, task types, and sample CRM data required for UI components to function.

## Project-Specific Patterns

### API Architecture
- **ViewSets:** All CRM entities use `ModelViewSet` pattern in `main/api_views.py`
- **Permissions:** Role-based access (Sales Reps see only their data, Sales Managers see all)
- **Activity Logging:** Automatic logging in `perform_create`/`perform_update` methods
- **Custom Fields:** Dynamic field system via `CustomField`/`CustomFieldValue` models

### Frontend Conventions
- **API Client:** Centralized in `frontend/src/api.js` with token interceptors
- **Auth Flow:** Token stored in localStorage, automatic 401 redirect to login
- **URL Structure:** RESTful - `/api/{resource}/` for CRUD operations

### Model Relationships
```python
# Key CRM entities with ownership patterns
Account → Contact (FK) → Deal (FK) → Interaction (FK)
CustomUser → Account.owner (Sales territory assignment)
```

### UI/UX Standards
- **Zebra Striping:** Use `.striped-table` class on all tables/lists
- **Compact Design:** Minimal padding/margins for horizontal space optimization
- **Navigation:** Fixed structure - Dashboard, Resources, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Orders, Warehouse, Staff

## Essential File Locations

2. **Frontend:** `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. **Combined:** Use VS Code Task `start-dev` for parallel startup

## Custom Field System Implementation

### Backend Architecture
- **Models:** `CustomField` + `CustomFieldValue` using Django's ContentTypes framework
- **Generic Relations:** Fields can attach to any model (Contact, Account, etc.)
- **Type System:** Support for text, number, date, boolean field types
- **Storage:** Separate columns (`value_text`, `value_number`, `value_date`, `value_boolean`)

```python
# Example: Adding custom fields to a Contact
CustomField.objects.create(
    name="LinkedIn Profile",
    field_type="text",
    content_type=ContentType.objects.get_for_model(Contact)
)
```

### Frontend Integration
- **Serializers:** `ContactWithCustomFieldsSerializer` includes custom field values
- **API Endpoints:** `/api/custom-fields/` and `/api/custom-field-values/`
- **Dynamic Forms:** Custom field inputs rendered based on field type

## API Endpoint Patterns

### REST Convention
```
GET    /api/{resource}/          # List with pagination, filtering
POST   /api/{resource}/          # Create new record
GET    /api/{resource}/{id}/     # Retrieve specific record
PUT    /api/{resource}/{id}/     # Update entire record
PATCH  /api/{resource}/{id}/     # Partial update
DELETE /api/{resource}/{id}/     # Delete record
```

### Role-Based Data Access
```python
def get_queryset(self):
    user = self.request.user
    if user.groups.filter(name='Sales Manager').exists():
        return Account.objects.all()  # Managers see all
    else:
        return Account.objects.filter(owner=user)  # Reps see only theirs
```

### Activity Logging Pattern
```python
def perform_create(self, serializer):
    serializer.save(owner=self.request.user)
    ActivityLog.objects.create(
        user=self.request.user,
        action='create',
        content_object=serializer.instance,
        description=f'Created {serializer.instance}'

## Database Model Relationships

### Core CRM Hierarchy
```python
CustomUser (owner field on all CRM entities)
├── Account (1:N with Contact, Deal)
│   ├── Contact (1:N with Interaction, Deal.primary_contact)
│   └── Deal (1:1 with Quote, 1:N with Invoice)
│       ├── Quote (1:N with QuoteItem)
│       └── Invoice (1:N with InvoiceItem)
│           └── Payment (M:N with Invoice)
└── Project (formerly Task - renamed 2025-09-28)
    ├── WorkOrder (1:N with Project)
    │   ├── WorkOrderInvoice (1:1 with WorkOrder)
    │   └── LineItem (1:N with WorkOrder)
    └── TimeEntry (1:N with Project)
```

### Accounting & Financial Models
```python
# Phase 1: Accounting Expansion
LedgerAccount (Chart of Accounts)
├── JournalEntry (Double-entry bookkeeping)
│   ├── debit_account (FK to LedgerAccount)
│   └── credit_account (FK to LedgerAccount)

└── period_end (DateField)

Payment (Payment Processing)
├── invoice (FK to Invoice/nullable)
├── work_order_invoice (FK to WorkOrderInvoice/nullable)
├── amount (DecimalField)
└── payment_method (CharField)
```

### Inventory & Operations Models
```python
# Phase 2: Workflow Automation
Warehouse (Inventory Management)
└── WarehouseItem (Stock Items)
    ├── name (CharField)
    ├── sku (CharField)
    ├── quantity (IntegerField)
    ├── minimum_stock (IntegerField)

TimeEntry (Time Tracking)
├── project (FK to Project)
├── user (FK to CustomUser)
├── date (DateField)
├── hours (DecimalField)
└── billable (BooleanField)
```

### Custom Fields Architecture
```python
CustomField (defines field schema)
├── content_type (links to any model via ContentTypes)
└── CustomFieldValue (stores actual values)
    ├── Generic FK to any model instance
    └── Type-specific value columns (value_text, value_number, etc.)
```

### Activity Logging
```python
ActivityLog (tracks all CRM actions)
├── Generic FK to any model instance
├── user (who performed the action)
└── action type (create, update, delete)
```

## Development Debugging Workflows

### Backend Debugging
- **Django Admin:** All CRM models registered - access at `/admin/`
- **API Testing:** Use `/api/` for browsable DRF interface
- **Database Inspection:** SQLite browser or Django shell (`py manage.py shell`)
- **Logging:** Activity logs stored in database via custom `DatabaseLogHandler`

### Frontend Debugging
- **Network Tab:** Monitor API calls in browser DevTools
- **React DevTools:** Inspect component state and context
- **Console Errors:** Check for 401/403 auth issues, API response errors
- **Token Issues:** Check localStorage for `authToken`, verify in Network tab headers

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **"Invalid Credentials":** User may not exist - use `py manage.py createsuperuser`
- **403 Forbidden:** Check user groups (`Sales Rep` vs `Sales Manager`)
- **Custom Fields Not Showing:** Verify `ContentType` matches target model
- **Data Not Loading:** Check `seed_data` command was run after migrations
